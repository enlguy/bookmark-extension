I have been using various YouTube bookmark extensions for years.  I find them especially useful when doing long tutorials on YouTube for coding, or any other long-form content I engage with, as you can’t finish these in one sitting, and can only guess at where you left off, later.  It seems no matter which extension I’ve used, at some point it just stops working, and it’s never supported enough to come back from the dead.  I’m fed up, as today the last resort extension I was using failed.  So..  Now I’ve created my own.
I slapped this together in about an hour, I’m still looking at adding styling to make it a little more visually appealing, but it’s tested and fully functional.
